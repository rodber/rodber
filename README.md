# Hey there 👋🏾

I'm a self-taught software developer from Chile. People may (not) know me for being the **single developer** who creates [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) image hosting software and [Chevere](https://chevere.org/) framework.

- 👀 I'm looking for collaborators (want to help me?)
- 📝 I blog at [rodolfo.is](https://rodolfo.is/)
- 🥑 I work with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL (plus all the usual web dongle) 
- 🎓 I'm a metallurgical engineer
- 🐧 I ❤ dev on Linux

## Avaibility for work

If you use Chevereto or any of the software I made I'm available for custom work and support. Do please note that I'm not available for any kind of job outside the realm of my software.
