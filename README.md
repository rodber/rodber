# Hey there 👋🏾

I'm an indie software developer from Chile. Some may know me for being the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) and [Chevere](https://chevere.org/).

I started with development when I was in college (I'm a Metallurgical Engineer) by doing simple webpages. I self-taught my way into developing software and since 2007 I've been making Chevereto.

❤ You can [donate](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios) to support my work. I'm mostly into self-hosted software.

## Available for hire

I'm specialized in backend PHP software and I've plenty years of experience with it. I can design systems, code review, quality assurance, modernizing and consulting for any kind of PHP project.

I live in Chile and I'm available for remote work,  I'm willing to move overseas if needed.
