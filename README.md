# Hey there 👋🏾

I'm an indie software developer from Chile. Some may know me for being the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) and [Chevere](https://chevere.org/).

I started with development when I was in college (I'm a Metallurgical engineer) by doing simple webpages. I self-tough my way into developing software and since 2007 I've been developing Chevereto. I've made my career around my own software.

I'm proud of Chevereto and likely you have already used as is _everywhere_. For real.

❤ You can [donate](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios) to support my work. I'm mostly into self-hosted software.

- 📝 I blog at [rodolfo.is](https://rodolfo.is/)
- 👀 I'm looking for collaborators
- 🥑 I work with PHP, JavaScript and SQL (plus all the usual dongle) 
- 🐧 I dev on Linux

## Availability for work

I'm available for custom work and support for any of the software I made. I'm also available to code review and quality assurance for any kind of PHP project.
