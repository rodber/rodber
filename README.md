# Rodolfo Berrios

I'm the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/), [xrDebug](https://xrdebug.com/) and the [Chevere](https://chevere.org/) organization. I design and build custom systems from scratch, my speciality is in server-side software and database design. I build systems for the long term, with a strong focus in efficiency and high performance. I use my own low level tools and adapt to any technology.

I *may* be available for contract work, feel free to ask.
