# Hey there 👋🏾

I'm an indie software developer from Chile. Some may know me for being the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) and [Chevere](https://chevere.org/).

I started with development when I was in college (I'm a Metallurgical Engineer) by doing simple webpages. I self-taught my way into developing software and since 2007 I've been making Chevereto.

I'm proud of Chevereto and for being able to build my career around my own software.

❤ You can [donate](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios) to support my work. I'm mostly into self-hosted software.

- 📝 I blog at [rodolfo.is](https://rodolfo.is/)
- 👀 I'm looking for collaborators
- 🥑 I work with server-side software
- 🐧 I dev on Linux
- 🤗 También hablo español

## Availability for work

I'm available for custom work and support for any of the software I made. I'm also available to code review, quality assurance and consulting for any kind of PHP-based project.
