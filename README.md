# Hey there 👋🏾

I'm an indie software developer from Chile. Some may know me for being the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) and [Chevere](https://chevere.org/).

❤ You can [donate](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios) to support my work. I'm mostly into self-hosted software.

- 📝 I blog at [rodolfo.is](https://rodolfo.is/)
- 👀 I'm looking for collaborators
- 🥑 I work with PHP, JavaScript and SQL (plus all the usual dongle) 
- 🐧 I dev on Linux

## Avaibility for work

I'm available for custom work and support for any of the software I made. I'm also available to code review and quality assurance.
